Instructions to Run the Project:
Hey! If you want to see this Age Calculator project running on your computer, it's super easy.
All you have to do is make sure those three files, index.html, style.css, and script.js are all saved together in the exact same folder on your hard drive.
Once they're all there, just find the index.html file and double-click it. Your browser (like Chrome or Firefox) will automatically open the page.
From there, just click inside the date box to bring up the calendar, pick a birthday, and hit the "Calculate" button. The app will immediately show you the age, and you'll be good to go!
